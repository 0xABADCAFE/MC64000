## Tutorial 4 : Conditional

### Making it personal

In the last turotial we used the Standard Test Host to perform some output. The host also provides us with access to commandline parameters:

```asm
; Hello, you...

main:
    bsr     io_init

    move.q  host_cli_num_params, d0
    blt.q   d0, #3, exit

    lea     .hello_name_1, a0
    bsr     io_print_string

    move.q  host_cli_params, a2
    move.q  16(a2), a0
    bsr     io_print_string

    lea     .hello_name_2, a0
    bsr     io_print_string

exit:
    bsr     io_done
    rts

.hello_name_1:
    dc.b "Hello, \0"

.hello_name_2:
    dc.b "!\n\0"
```

Running this gives a more user friendly greeting, provided we give it a name to work with:

```shell
:~/tutorial$ ~/MC64000/assembler/run64k tutorial.64x Bob 2>/dev/null
Hello, Bob!
```

There is rather more going on in this example:

* We explicitly initialise the IO Vector using a call to `io_init` and finalize with `io_done`.
   - Generally, all host provided vectors should be initialised and finalised this way, in order to ensure any resources are properly aquired and released.
* We check the argument count. Unlike the 680x0, conditional branching is by direct comparison. If the argument count is less than 3, we skip to the exit.
* We print the third CLI parameter. The host provides `host_cli_params` which is an array of string pointers. Since each pointer is 8 bytes, the offset we want is 16,
