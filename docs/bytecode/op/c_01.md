## HCF

Halt and Call Function / Catch Fire.

General syntax:

        hcf <#N>

* Halts the interpreter and passes control back to the host environment.
* Extension byte 1 must be 0xFF or this opcode be interpreted as Halt and Cach Fire.
* N is the 8 bit index of a host native function to call. The host can therefore expose a maximum of 256 directly accessible entry points to the interpreter. What these do depends entirely on the host application.
* If N is not a recognised host function ID, the interpreter will halt with Unknown Host Call.

| Mnemonic | Bytecode | Ext 1 | Ext 2 |
| - | - | - | - |
| `hcf #<N>` | 0x00 | 0xFF | *NN* |
