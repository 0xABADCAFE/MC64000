## BRA

Branch.

        pc + d -> pc

General syntax:

        bra[.b] <#<D>|label>

* Branch distance is measured from the end of the instruction.
    - e.g. `bra #0` would theoretically branch to the next instruction.
    - Zero displacement is reserved for the unresolved forwards reference during assembly.
    - Negative displacements must be larger than the complete branch instruction.
* Short .b form requires the label to resolve to a displacement within -128 ... 127 bytes of the current Program Counter.
* Standard form requires the label to resolve to a displacement within -2147483648 ... 2147483647 bytes of the current Program Counter.
