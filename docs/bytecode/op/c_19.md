## DBNZ

Decrement counter and branch if not zero.

        <ea> - 1 -> <ea>; if (<ea> == 0) then pc + d -> pc

General syntax:

        dbnz <ea>, <#<D>|label>

* Branch distance is measured from the end of the instruction.
    - e.g. `dbnz r0, #0` would theoretically branch to the next instruction.
    - Zero displacement is reserved for the unresolved forwards reference during assembly.
    - Negative displacements must be larger than the complete branch instruction.
* Effective address is accessed as 32-bit unsigned counter.
