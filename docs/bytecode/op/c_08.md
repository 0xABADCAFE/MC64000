## BNZ/FBNZ

Branch if operand is not zero.

        if (<ea> != 0) then pc + d -> pc

General syntax:

        bnz.<b|w|l|q> <ea>, <#<D>|label>
        fbnz.<s|d> <ea>, <#<D>|label>

* Branch distance is measured from the end of the instruction.
    - e.g. `bnz.l r0, #0` would theoretically branch to the next instruction.
    - Zero displacement is reserved for the unresolved forwards reference during assembly.
    - Negative displacements must be larger than the complete branch instruction.
* Two-byte opcode:
    - First byte selects monadic branch on condition.
    - Second byte selects the comparison type and implied operand types.
