## LOADM

Load multiple registers.

        <ea> -> register list

General syntax:

        loadm <ea>, <#<R>|register list>

* Register list is 32-bit mask of saved registers.
* Bits 0:15 refer to the General Purpose Register set.
* Bits 16:31 refer to the Floating Point Register set.
* For each bit position, if the bit is set, the corresponding register is loaded.
* Only register indirect pre/post inc/decrement Effective Address modes allowed.
