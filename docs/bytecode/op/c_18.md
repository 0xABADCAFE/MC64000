## BBC

Branch if bit is clear.

        if ( ((1 << <ea(s)>) & <ea(d)>) == 0 ) then pc + d -> pc

General syntax:

        bbc.<b|w|l|q> <ea(s)>, <ea(d)>

* Branch distance is measured from the end of the instruction.
    - e.g. `bbc.l r0, r1, #0` would theoretically branch to the next instruction.
    - Zero displacement is reserved for the unresolved forwards reference during assembly.
    - Negative displacements must be larger than the complete branch instruction.
* All possible integer Effective Address modes are valid for source and destination.
* Source value is accessed as a byte, modulo by the operation size.
* Two-byte opcode:
    - First byte selects dyadic branch on condition.
    - Second byte selects the comparison type and implied operand types.
