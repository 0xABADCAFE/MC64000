## General Purpose Register Indirect, Post Decrement

The contents of the register are used as the address of the operand data in memory. The contents of the register are then decremented by the operation size.

General syntax: `(r<N>)-`

* Allowed register names: r0 ... r15, a0 ... a7, sp
* All bits of the register are used.

| Mode | Bytecode |
| - | - |
| `(r0)-` | R0_IND_POST_DEC |
| `(r1)-` | R1_IND_POST_DEC |
| ... | ... |
| `(r15)-` | R15_IND_POST_DEC |
