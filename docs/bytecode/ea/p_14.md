## Same As Destination

The fully evaluated destination operand address is used for the source operand in memory.

* This mode cannot be explicitly specified.
    - Used where the Source Effective Address mode is the same as the Destination Effective Address mode and that mode does not have any increment/decrement behaviour.
* Cannot be used for destination operands.
* Bytecode / decode logic optimisation.

| Mode | Bytecode |
| - | - |
|   | 0xB0 |
