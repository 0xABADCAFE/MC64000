## General Purpose Register Indirect, Pre Decrement

The contents of the register are decremented by the operation size. The contents of the register are then used as the address of the operand data in memory.

General syntax: `-(r<N>)`

* Allowed register names: r0 ... r15, a0 ... a7, sp
* All bits of the register are used.

| Mode | Bytecode |
| - | - |
| `-(r0)` | R0_IND_PRE_DEC |
| `-(r1)` | R1_IND_PRE_DEC |
| ... | ... |
| `-(r15)` | R15_IND_PRE_DEC |
