## Import Index

Enumerated index for imported symbol reference.

* Used for imported symbols that are not resolved until runtime.
* Each import symbol is enumerated by the assembler and the enumerated value mapped to relevant addresses by the host at runtime.
* The enumeration is an unsigned 32-bit value that follows the EA byte.

|  | 0xB1 | 0x*II* | 0x*II* | 0x*II* | 0x*II* |
