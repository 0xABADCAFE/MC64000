## General Purpose Register Indirect, Post Increment

The contents of the register are used as the address of the operand data in memory. The contents of the register are then incremented by the operation size.

General syntax: `(r<N>)+`

* Allowed register names: r0 ... r15, a0 ... a7, sp
* All bits of the register are used.

| Mode | Bytecode |
| - | - |
| `(r0)+` | 0x20 |
| `(r1)+` | 0x21 |
| ... | ... |
| `(r15)+` | 0x2F |
