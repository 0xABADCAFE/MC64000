## General Purpose Register Indirect, Pre Increment

The contents of the register are incremented by the operation size. The contents of the register are then used as the address of the operand data in memory.

General syntax: `+(r<N>)`

* Allowed register names: r0 ... r15, a0 ... a7, sp
* All bits of the register are used.

| Mode | Bytecode |
| - | - |
| `+(r0)` | R0_IND_PRE_INC |
| `+(r1)` | R1_IND_PRE_INC |
| ... | ... |
| `+(r15)` | R15_IND_PRE_INC |
