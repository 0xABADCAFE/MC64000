## [Documentation](../README.md) > Bytecode Format

This section covers the interpretable bytecode format of the MC64K and forms the most complete documentation on the Instruction Set and Effective Addresses.

Until all opcode is completely finalised, all opcode values shall be referred to by their enumeration name. Please refer to the [instruction](../../assembler/src/defs/mnemonic/) and [addressing](../../assembler/src/defs/effective_address/) sources for their numerical values.
